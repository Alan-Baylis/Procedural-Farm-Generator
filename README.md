Clone the repo and open MainScene. Select the `MapGenerator` object, adjust the `seed` value in the inspector (shown above) and click 
Generate. Based on the seed, the farm scene will be generated in the editor. Use the editor controls to navigate.

## Thanks
Special thanks to [Sebastian Lague's video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbpMiKiSKm8) on procedural landmass generation
that forms the basis of the generator.
